                    A QR Code is a two-dimensional barcode that is readable by smartphones.
                    It allows to encode over 4000 characters in a two dimensional barcode.
                    QR Codes may be used to display text to the user, to open a URL, save
                    a contact to the address book or to compose text messages. "QR Code"
                    is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED.
                    
                    To read QR Codes with your smartphone, you need an appropriate software
                    installed on your phone. For Android-based devices, you can use Barcode
                    Scanner by ZXing. On iOS-Devices like iPhones there are also QR Code 
                    readers available on the AppStore, for Example i-nigma. On Firefox OS
                    try QR Code Scanner. On Symbian devices, you can use Mobiletag barcodes
                    reader for example.
                    
                    If you use a modern web browser (recent versions of Firefox or Chrome)
                    and have a webcam, this site allows you to scan QR Codes with your web 
                    browser. You can use this to send a link from a phone to your desktop
                    browser for example.
                    
                    Are the QR Codes generated on this site restricted to personal use?
                    No! There is no restriction of any kind. You can use these QR Code images
                    for whatever you like, also commercially. Please note that the word
                    "QR Code" is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED. If you

                    <b>What are Dynamic QR Codes?</b></br>
                    The content of a QR Code cannot be changed once generated. What is sometimes 
                    referred to as a Dynamic QR Code, is a QR Code pointing to a static URL that 
                    hosts the actual content (e.g. the real URL). The hosted content can be 
                    changed after the QR Code has been printed.
                    After signing in with a Google Account, this site also allows you to generate
                    Dynamic QR Codes (available under My Codes). They can be handled exactly as 
                    our normal QR Codes. We automatically create a static URL for you that points
                    to your actual content. We provide simple view tracking for these Codes. You
                    can also enter a Google Analytics Tracking ID for advanced tracking.
                    This service is offered completely free of charge without any restrictions.
